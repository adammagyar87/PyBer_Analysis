# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Following a meeting with the CEO, we determined another analysis we would like to look into was the data based on city type. We decided to compose a DataFrame with the relevant data and to produce a visual graph to represent this.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The results demonstrate that the Urban cities comprise of a majority of the rides and total fares, although the average fares per ride and per driver are lower compared to the suburban and rural areas.

These results are consistent month to month as well. Every week the Urban cities generated the most revenue, the Suburban cities generated the second most, while the Rural cities generated lowest. The ratios were very similar as well.

## Summary: 
Rural areas have the highest average fare although the fewest rides and lowest revenue.  The best profit margins are in these areas and expanding may provide the best percentage return for the investment. 

There is a correlation in the total rides vs the total drivers to the average fare. It is more favorable to have fewer drivers than riders.

There are a surplus of drivers in the Urban cities. For approximately every 3 drivers there were only 2 rides. Urban cities are the source for the most revenue, and a stronger marketing campaign should be used in these areas to lead to an increase in the amount of rides.
